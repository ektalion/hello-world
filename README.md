Hi!

I am a Computer Science Engineer, i like 3D rendering and video games. 
I will work my way up to become a graphics programmer and a Game Designer in the video game industry. 
Until i work for Nintendo and live in Japan, i will never give up.
Today is the start of my journey to achieve my dreams.
